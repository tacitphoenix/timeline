# Git Rebase Timeline Challenge

They finally did it those mad intergalactic scientists
spread commits to a readme file between commits to other
files causing a temporal disruption.

Use git rebase to reorder and squash the readme commits 
in order to **save the timeline**.

# Steps

1. Create a branch to use for the challenge.
2. Use git log to investigate the commits.
3. Identify the first commit and interactively rebase
4. Reorder the readme commit (conveniently logged 'readme')
5. Squash all the readme commits into one.
6. Update the README.md with a status of complete.

# Next Steps

Save other **timelines**!
